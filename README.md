### **Motivation:**
Memory is one of the most important higher brain function regarded as a cornerstone of personality formation. Neural oscillations and, in particular, low-to-high syncrhonization, are thought to play a essential role in memory formation (Jensen and Colgin 2007, Fell and Axmacher, 2011). Gamma-band (30-100 Hz) modulation of oscillatory activity has been reported in various memory paradigms and may be the result, or cause, of feature binding processes (Hassler et al., 2013; Sederberg et al., 2007). Theta oscillations (3-6 Hz) are similarly involved in memory encoding, retrieval and functioning (Jensen and Tesche 2002; Friese et al., 2013). Additionally to theta and gamma bands, beta (13-30 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) decreases in activity are correlated with increased recall (Backus 2016). Various studies have shown increase PAC between theta and gamma (Canolty, 2006, Demiralp 2007, Sauseng 2008, Koster 2014). With this repository we aimed to observe these results in a previously acquired database published in 2020 (Cruzat et al. 2020).
